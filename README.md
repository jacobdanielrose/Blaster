# Blaster

Programming a multiplayer game following the Udemy course by Stephen Ulibarri called:
Unreal Engine 5 C++ Multiplayer Shooter

https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-cpp-multiplayer-shooter/

I am building this using pre-purchased assets

The goal is to follow the course to gain the skills necessary to build a full fledged game. 
Once I finish the course I will either start a new project entirely or fork this repo and expand upon it.
